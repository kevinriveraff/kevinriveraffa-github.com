            <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
            <p>benito juarez was the best becauseHe was of poor, rural, indigenous origins, but he became a well-educated, urban professional and politician, who married a socially prominent woman of Oaxaca City, Margarita Maza.[3] He identified primarily as a Liberal and wrote only briefly about his indigenous heritage.[4]</p>

<p>He held power during the tumultuous decade of the Liberal Reform and French invasion. In 1858 as head of the Supreme Court, he became president of Mexico by the succession mandated by the Constitution of 1857 when moderate liberal President Ignacio Comonfort was forced to resign by Mexican conservatives.
